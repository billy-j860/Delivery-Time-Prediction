# Delivery-Time-Prediction
Predicting ETA - Estimated Time of Arrival (ETAs) for Sendy
## Problem Statement

In the logistics industry, accurate delivery time predictions are crucial for:
- Improving customer communication
- Optimizing resource allocation
- Reducing operational costs

Sendy faces challenges in providing precise estimated arrival times, which can lead to customer dissatisfaction and inefficient resource management.

## Solution Approach

This project utilizes historical delivery data to build a predictive model that:
1. Analyzes various factors affecting delivery times
2. Predicts the time from pickup to arrival for each order
3. Provides insights to optimize logistics operations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Data Manipulation and Analysis:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- Data Visualization:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Plotly Express
  - Missingno (for visualizing missing data)
- Machine Learning:
  - Scikit-learn (including LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, DecisionTreeRegressor, SVR, RandomForestRegressor)
  - Model Selection: train_test_split, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV
  - Metrics: mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
- Preprocessing:
  - LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
- Additional Libraries:
  - datetime (for time-based features)
  - scipy.stats (for statistical functions)

## Key Features

- Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation and comparison of multiple regression models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Detailed visualization of data insights and model performance

## Results and Impact

(Add a summary of your model's performance and potential impact once you've completed the project)

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporation of real-time traffic data
- Development of a user-friendly interface for predictions
- Integration with Sendy's existing systems
